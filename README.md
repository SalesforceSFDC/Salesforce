| Rule | What it defines |
| ---- | ---- |
| Matching rule | The matching criteria to identify duplicate records. Salesforce comes with three standard matching rules: one for business accounts; one for contacts and leads, and another for person accounts. |
| Duplicate rule | When Salesforce engages matching rules and determines actions to take as it encounters duplicates.  Sales reps see an alert that theyâ€™re about to create a duplicate or your reps are blocked from creating the duplicate altogether. |
